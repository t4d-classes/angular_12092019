# Exercise 5

0. Complete the edit car row form. Only display input fields for make, model, year, color and price. And prepopulate the fields when the view row changes to edit row.

1. Add an edit button to the view car row. When the button is clicked set the `$scope.editCarId` to the car id of the row. Ensure the view row changes to edit row.

2. Add a save button to the edit car row. When the button is clicked, save the car data to the array and change the edit car row back to a view row.

3. Add a cancel button to the edit car row. When the button is clicked, discard the changes and change the row back to an view car row.

4. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
