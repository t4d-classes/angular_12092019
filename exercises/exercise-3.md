# Exercise 3

1. Using the same `CarToolController` controller, create an array of cars objects and assign it to new property named `cars` on the `$scope` object. Each car object should have the following properties: id, make, model, year, color, and price. Please do not create an array of arrays or one array for each car property. Please do not use JavaScript classes to create car, just create an array literal of object literals.

2. Add table (using the table element and related elements). The table should display a column for each car object property.

3. Populate the table with the array of car objects.

4. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
