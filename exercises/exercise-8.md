# Exercise 8

1. Add code to re-enable the delete, save, edit and cancel functionality of the table.

2. Move the car form to its own directive. Use the new directive to replace the current car form in Car Tool. There is no need to create a separate file (this will be a bonus).

3. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.

4. Bonus: Divide the directives into different files.
