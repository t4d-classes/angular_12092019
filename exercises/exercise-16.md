# Exercise 16

1. Apply the principles covered in class, convert the "ngjs-widget-tool-app" to modern Angular.

    - Use the earlier examples in class to plan out your component tree
    - Consider how controllers, directives, and components map to Angular Components
    - How do bindings and scope configurations map to modern Angular inputs and outputs
    - Feel free to copy and paste as needed from earlier exercises - be careful to update names correctly.

2. Create a new modern Angular application using the Angular CLI.

3. Use a new module for all of the widget tool parts which will be added. Use a new shared module for the tool header component.

4. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
