3. Implement the `CarsSvc` class to manage an array of cars. The array of cars should be managed within the CarsSvc class and methods should be provided for getting all of the cars, appending a car, replacing a car, and delete a car.

4. Utilize the `CarsSvc` in the Car Home component to manage the data and the various operations performed on the array of cars.

5. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
