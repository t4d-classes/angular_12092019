# Exercise 20

1. Enhance the `CarsSvc` to use the `HttpClient` service to use REST API operations to manage car data. Be sure to cover all existing methods such as getting all of the cars, appending a car, replacing a car, and deleting a car.

    - Run the Cars REST service from the AngularJS Car Tool App. You may need to update the port number to not conflict with the port number for the Colors REST service. You will need to run both as the  Modern Angular App includes both Colors and Cars.

2. Update the Car Home component code to use the enhanced `CarsSvc`.

3. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
