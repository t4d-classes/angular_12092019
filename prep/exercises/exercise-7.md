# Exercise 7

0. Move the Car Tool to it own directive similar to how we moved color tool.

1. Utilize the `toolHeader` directive created during the demo in the Color Tool App. Please just copy and paste the relevant parts of the code into the Car Tool App. Replace the current header content with the new directive.

2. Move the car table element and its children to a new directive named `carTable`. Do not include support for the delete, edit, save and cancel buttons (this will be done later).

3. Replace the original car table with the new `carTable` directive.

4. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
