# Exercise 17

1. Create a new service named `carsSvc` using the `factory` method to manage an array of cars.

2. On the service, implement methods to return an array of cars, append a car, replace a car and delete a car. Ensure all methods perform immutable operations on the array of cars.

3. Inject the service into the Car Tool controller and update the various methods of the controller to use the service for managing car data.

4. Run the application and verify it works. Be sure to check your terminal window and browser console for errors.
